# Mobile App Development

ATLS 4120/5120, Fall 2022
<br />
Zef Houssney — [zef.houssney@colorado.edu](mailto:zef.houssney@colorado.edu)

## There's an App for That.

Or is there? There are lots of apps. But what about _that_ one? As an iOS
developer, people have been telling me about their app ideas for over a decade.
I've learned that while there are tons of amazing apps out there, there's still
a ton of room for new concepts, ideas, and implementations.

As our devices and the developer tools that drive them continue to gain new
capabilities, the potential for new types of apps that weren't previously
possible just keeps growing.

## Objective

You will learn how to design and develop iOS applications in a hands-on and
collaborative environment. In this class, you will:

- Create iOS Applications using Apple's native frameworks and developer tools.
- Become proficient in Swift and the tools to thrive in the iOS app development environment.
- Use source control (git) for code management and collaboration.
- Explore user interface design and user experience through examples, discussion, and implementation.
- Practice constructive criticism and code review with peers.

## Class Resources

Class resources will be posted at [https://zef.github.io/ATLAS-iOS/](https://zef.github.io/ATLAS-iOS/).

The source for that page is in the `html` folder of the course repo at [https://github.com/zef/ATLAS-iOS](https://github.com/zef/ATLAS-iOS).

I will probably use Canvas too for some things, but it's likely that most of the
class resources will be at the site and repo above.

## Pre-requisites

ATLS-1300 Code/Computational Foundations 1, CSCI-1300 Computer Science 1, or an
equivalent course is a required prerequisite.  Knowledge of basic programming
concepts is necessary for this course. For students that have not taken either
course listed above, please come speak with me.

## Required Materials

- A Mac with [Xcode 14](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- An Internet Connection
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A Can-Do Attitude

Lab Macs in the ATLAS building are available and should have Xcode installed.
If you don't have a Mac of your own, let's talk.

## Grading

I will seek to follow the ATLAS reccomended scale:
```
A = excellent work
B = above average work
C = average or competent work
D = below average work
F = unsatisfactory work
```
I recognize that levels of experience and ability vary, and I don't expect
everyone to be at the same skill level. Students must demonstrate that they are
putting in time, effort, and work to do good work and challenge themselves to
learn and improve.

## Work Due Dates

Assignments must be pushed to GitHub prior to the start of class on the due
date. Late work will be penalized 10% per day that it's late. In case of
emergency, notify me if you will miss an assignment before the due date so we
can discuss special arrangements.


## Code Plagiarism

If you copy or utilize code from the internet, you should understand what it
does, and how it works. Add code comments that reference the URL from which the
code was copied, and note anything interesting about it.

Third-party code libraries can be used, but you must develop a significant
portion of your project through your own code as well. A project can tie
together

Copying code from any source without citation is considered plagiarism and will
be dealt with in accordance with the CU Honor Code.


## Workload

This course is very technical and challenging and requires a great deal of time
and commitment. Students should plan on spending 2-3 hours of outside class time
for every hour in class. For this class, that translates to 8-12 hours per week
of work outside of class. I welcome any students that are concerned about the
time commitment or find themselves struggling to please talk to me personally.


## Absence

If you expect to be absent due to illness or another reason, please let me know ahead of time in person, or
[send me an email at zef.houssney@colorado.edu](mailto:zef.houssney@colorado.edu?subject=Absence%20Notification).

Also, please inform any classmates that you are collaborating with on group
projects.
