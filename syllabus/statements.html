<h2>Classroom Behavior</h2>
<p>Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate<br />
learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person,<br />
remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards<br />
may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are<br />
especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with<br />
race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed,<br />
religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,<br />
veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. For more<br />
information, see the policies on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom<br />
behavior</a><br />
and the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct">Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution<br />
policies</a>.</p>
<h2>Requirements for COVID-19</h2>
<p>As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder<br />
community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department<br />
and building requirements and all public health orders in place to<br />
reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently<br />
requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and<br />
students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination<br />
and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral<br />
grounds through the <a href="https://mycuhealth.colorado.edu/">MyCUHealth portal</a>.</p>
<p>The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public<br />
health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms,<br />
students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to<br />
leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who<br />
refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/">Student<br />
Conduct and Conflict Resolution</a>. For<br />
more information, see the policy on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom<br />
behavior</a><br />
and the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/">Student Code of Conduct</a>. If<br />
you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from<br />
fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the<br />
&quot;Accommodation for Disabilities&quot; statement on this syllabus.</p>
<p>If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested<br />
positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially<br />
vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,<br />
you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the<br />
<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation">Public Health Office</a><br />
(<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu">contacttracing@colorado.edu</a>). If you are fully vaccinated and have<br />
been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to<br />
stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the<br />
further guidance of the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation">Public Health Office</a><br />
(<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu">contacttracing@colorado.edu</a>).</p>
<h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
<p>If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit<br />
your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty<br />
member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.<br />
Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented<br />
disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting<br />
accommodations is located on the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/">Disability Services<br />
website</a>. Contact<br />
Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <a href="mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu">dsinfo@colorado.edu</a> for further<br />
assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition, see <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions">Temporary<br />

<h2>Preferred Student Names and Pronouns</h2>
<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always<br />
align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names<br />
and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns<br />
are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such<br />
updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's<br />
legal name.</p>
<h2>Honor Code</h2>
<p>All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are<br />
responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code academic<br />
integrity policy. Violations of the Honor Code may include, but are not<br />
limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat,<br />
unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the<br />
same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all<br />
course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All<br />
incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code<br />
(<a href="mailto:honor@colorado.edu">honor@colorado.edu</a>); 303-492-5550). Students found responsible for<br />
violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic<br />
sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the<br />
faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic<br />
integrity policy can be found on the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code">Honor Code<br />
website</a>.</p>

<p>CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming<br />
learning, working, and living environment. The university will not<br />
tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and<br />
assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence),<br />
stalking, or protected-class discrimination or harassment by or against<br />
members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject<br />

<p>Please know that faculty and graduate instructors have a responsibility<br />
to inform OIEC when they are made aware of incidents of sexual<br />
misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, discrimination,<br />
harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals<br />
impacted receive information about their rights, support resources, and<br />
reporting options. To learn more about reporting and support options for<br />

because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams,<br />
assignments or required attendance.</p>
