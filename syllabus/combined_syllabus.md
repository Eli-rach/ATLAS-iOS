# Mobile App Development

## There's an App for That.

Or is there? There are lots of apps. But what about _that_ one? As an iOS
developer, people have been telling me about their app ideas for over a decade.
I've learned that while there are tons of amazing apps out there, there are
always new c

As our devices and the developer tools that drive them continue to gain new
capabilities, the potential for new mobile apps is as exciting as ever.

## Objective

You will learn how to design and develop iOS applications in a hands-on and
collaborative environment. In this class, you will:

- Become proficient in Swift and tools to thrive in the iOS app development environment.
- Use source control (git) for code management and collaboration.
- Explore user interface design and user experience through examples, discussion, and implementation.
- Practice constructive criticism and code review with peers.
-

## Class Resources

Class resources will be posted online at https://github.com/zef/ATLAS-iOS

## Pre-requisites

ATLS-1300 Code/Computational Foundations 1, CSCI-1300 Computer Science 1, or an
equivalent course is a required prerequisite.  Knowledge of basic programming
concepts is necessary for this course. For students that have not taken either
course listed above, please come speak with me.

## Required Materials

- A Mac with [Xcode 14](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- An Internet Connection
- A Can-Do Attitude
- A GitHub account

Lab Macs in the ATLAS building are available and should have Xcode installed.
If you don't have a Mac of your own, let's talk.

## Grading

A = excellent work
B = above average work
C = average or competent work
D = below average work
F = unsatisfactory work

## Work Due Dates

Assignments must be pushed to GitHub prior to the start of class on the due
date. Late work will be penalized 10% per day that it's late. In case of
emergency, notify me if you will miss an assignment before the due date so we
can discuss special arrangements.


## Code Plagiarism

If you copy or utilize code from the internet, you should understand what it
does, and how it works. Add code comments that reference the URL from which the
code was copied, and note anything interesting about it.

Third-party code libraries can be used, but you must develop a significant
portion of your project through your own code as well. A project can tie
together

Copying code from any source without citation is considered plagiarism and will
be dealt with in accordance with the CU Honor Code.


## Workload

This course is very technical and challenging and requires a great deal of time
and commitment. Students should plan on spending 2-3 hours of outside class time
for every hour in class. For this class, that translates to 8-12 hours per week
of work outside of class. I welcome any students that are concerned about the
time commitment or find themselves struggling to please talk to me personally.


## Absence

If you expect to be absent due to illness or another reason, please let me know ahead of time in person, or
[send me an email at zef.houssney@colorado.edu](mailto:zef.houssney@colorado.edu?subject=Absence Notification).

Also, please inform any classmates that you are collaborating with on group
projects.

## Classroom Behavior

Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate
learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person,
remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards
may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are
especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed,
religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,
veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. For more
information, see the policies on [classroom
behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior)
and the [Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution
policies](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct).

## Requirements for COVID-19

As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder
community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department
and building requirements and all public health orders in place to
reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently
requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and
students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination
and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral
grounds through the [MyCUHealth portal](https://mycuhealth.colorado.edu/).

The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public
health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms,
students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to
leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who
refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to [Student
Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/). For
more information, see the policy on [classroom
behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior)
and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/). If
you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from
fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the
"Accommodation for Disabilities" statement on this syllabus.

If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested
positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially
vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,
you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the
[Public Health Office](https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation)
(<contacttracing@colorado.edu>). If you are fully vaccinated and have
been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to
stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the
further guidance of the [Public Health Office](https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation)
(<contacttracing@colorado.edu>).

## Accommodation for Disabilities

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit
your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty
member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.
Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented
disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting
accommodations is located on the [Disability Services
website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact
Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <dsinfo@colorado.edu> for further
assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary
Medical
Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions)
on the Disability Services website.

## Preferred Student Names and Pronouns

CU Boulder recognizes that students\' legal information doesn\'t always
align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names
and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns
are listed on instructors\' class rosters. In the absence of such
updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student\'s
legal name.

## Honor Code

integrity policy. Violations of the Honor Code may include, but are not
limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat,
unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the
same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all

violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic
sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the
faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic
integrity policy can be found on the [Honor Code
website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).
