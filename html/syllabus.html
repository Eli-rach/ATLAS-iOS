<h1 id="mobile-app-development">Mobile App Development</h1>
<p>ATLS 4120/5120, Fall 2022 <br /> Zef Houssney — <a
href="mailto:zef.houssney@colorado.edu">zef.houssney@colorado.edu</a></p>
<h2 id="theres-an-app-for-that.">There’s an App for That.</h2>
<p>Or is there? There are lots of apps. But what about <em>that</em>
one? As an iOS developer, people have been telling me about their app
ideas for over a decade. I’ve learned that while there are tons of
amazing apps out there, there’s still a ton of room for new concepts,
ideas, and implementations.</p>
<p>As our devices and the developer tools that drive them continue to
gain new capabilities, the potential for new types of apps that weren’t
previously possible just keeps growing.</p>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>You will learn how to design and develop iOS applications in a
hands-on and collaborative environment. In this class, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create iOS Applications using Apple’s native frameworks and
developer tools.</li>
<li>Become proficient in Swift and the tools to thrive in the iOS app
development environment.</li>
<li>Use source control (git) for code management and collaboration.</li>
<li>Explore user interface design and user experience through examples,
discussion, and implementation.</li>
<li>Practice constructive criticism and code review with peers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-resources">Class Resources</h2>
<p>Class resources will be posted at <a
href="https://zef.github.io/ATLAS-iOS/">https://zef.github.io/ATLAS-iOS/</a>.</p>
<p>The source for that page is in the <code>html</code> folder of the
course repo at <a
href="https://github.com/zef/ATLAS-iOS">https://github.com/zef/ATLAS-iOS</a>.</p>
<p>I will probably use Canvas too for some things, but it’s likely that
most of the class resources will be at the site and repo above.</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>ATLS-1300 Code/Computational Foundations 1, CSCI-1300 Computer
Science 1, or an equivalent course is a required prerequisite. Knowledge
of basic programming concepts is necessary for this course. For students
that have not taken either course listed above, please come speak with
me.</p>
<h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Mac with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode
14</a></li>
<li>An Internet Connection</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account</li>
<li>A Can-Do Attitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Lab Macs in the ATLAS building are available and should have Xcode
installed. If you don’t have a Mac of your own, let’s talk.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>I will seek to follow the ATLAS reccomended scale:</p>
<pre><code>A = excellent work
B = above average work
C = average or competent work
D = below average work
F = unsatisfactory work</code></pre>
<p>I recognize that levels of experience and ability vary, and I don’t
expect everyone to be at the same skill level. Students must demonstrate
that they are putting in time, effort, and work to do good work and
challenge themselves to learn and improve.</p>
<h2 id="work-due-dates">Work Due Dates</h2>
<p>Assignments must be pushed to GitHub prior to the start of class on
the due date. Late work will be penalized 10% per day that it’s late. In
case of emergency, notify me if you will miss an assignment before the
due date so we can discuss special arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="code-plagiarism">Code Plagiarism</h2>
<p>If you copy or utilize code from the internet, you should understand
what it does, and how it works. Add code comments that reference the URL
from which the code was copied, and note anything interesting about
it.</p>
<p>Third-party code libraries can be used, but you must develop a
significant portion of your project through your own code as well. A
project can tie together</p>
<p>Copying code from any source without citation is considered
plagiarism and will be dealt with in accordance with the CU Honor
Code.</p>
<h2 id="workload">Workload</h2>
<p>This course is very technical and challenging and requires a great
deal of time and commitment. Students should plan on spending 2-3 hours
of outside class time for every hour in class. For this class, that
translates to 8-12 hours per week of work outside of class. I welcome
any students that are concerned about the time commitment or find
themselves struggling to please talk to me personally.</p>
<h2 id="absence">Absence</h2>
<p>If you expect to be absent due to illness or another reason, please
let me know ahead of time in person, or <a
href="mailto:zef.houssney@colorado.edu?subject=Absence%20Notification">send
me an email at zef.houssney@colorado.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Also, please inform any classmates that you are collaborating with on
group projects.</p>

<h2 id="classroom-behavior">Classroom Behavior</h2>
<p>Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an
appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether
in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral
standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and
sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and
topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age,
disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political
philosophy. For more information, see the policies on <a
href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom
behavior</a> and the <a
href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct">Student Conduct
&amp; Conflict Resolution policies</a>.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-covid-19">Requirements for COVID-19</h2>
<p>As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU
Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university,
department and building requirements and all public health orders in
place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder
currently requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty,
staff and students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of
vaccination and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical,
ethical or moral grounds through the <a
href="https://mycuhealth.colorado.edu/">MyCUHealth portal</a>.</p>
<p>The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public
health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms,
students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to
leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who
refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to <a
href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/">Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution</a>. For more information, see the policy on <a
href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom
behavior</a> and the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/">Student
Code of Conduct</a>. If you require accommodation because a disability
prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the
steps in the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this
syllabus.</p>
<p>If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested
positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially
vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,
you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the <a
href="https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation">Public
Health Office</a> (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu"

vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,
you do not need to stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for
symptoms and follow the further guidance of the <a
href="https://www.colorado.edu/health/public-health/quarantine-and-isolation">Public
Health Office</a> (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu"

<h2 id="preferred-student-names-and-pronouns">Preferred Student Names
and Pronouns</h2>
<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always
align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names
and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns
are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such
updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's
legal name.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h2>
<p>All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are
responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code academic
integrity policy. Violations of the Honor Code may include, but are not
