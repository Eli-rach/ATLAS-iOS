#### Assignment:

- Read [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html).
- Read [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/accessibility)
- Read [App icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/app-icons)

If you want, start messing around with Swift in the [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)
app or in Xcode.

#### Links and Resources

- [swift.org](https://www.swift.org)
  - "Getting Started" is about installation. You probably don't need this after
  installing Xcode.
  - The [Swift Book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) section of the site is
  great.
  - We will be continuing on to [The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) after today's assignment, "A Swift Tour".

- I mentioned the [Stanford SwiftUI course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu) as an excellent resource for learning some fundamentals of Swift and SwiftUI.

#### Action Items:

- Download, Install and open [Xcode 14](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Install Command Line Tools when directed.
- Make sure you have an Apple ID and sign in to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) with it.
- Have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

[Xcode Releases](https://xcodereleases.com) is a handy site that organizes download links to versions of Xcode.

I mentioned the [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)
app for iPad, but I forgot that there's a Mac version too! This is a great way
to get started with Swift, so check that out too.
