#### Action Items:

- Download, Install and open [Xcode 14](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Install Command Line Tools when directed.
- Make sure you have an Apple ID and sign in to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) with it.
- Have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

[Xcode Releases](https://xcodereleases.com) is a handy site that organizes download links to versions of Xcode.

I mentioned the [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)
app for iPad, but I forgot that there's a Mac version too! This is a great way
to get started with Swift, so check that out too.
