## 07 — App Lab

2022-09-14, Wednesday

### Assignment:

- Make a group of 3-4 students in which you will do code reviews and provide feedback for one another.

- Get up-to-date on the recent repo assignments:
  - Make sure I have your GitHub username in [`github_usernames.txt`](https://github.com/zef/ATLAS-iOS/blob/main/github_usernames.txt)
  - Make sure you have an app idea documented in your class repo at `ATLAS-iOS-Fall-22`.
  - Add the `config.yml` file as listed the Assignment from `06`
- Add `name: Your Name` to that config file, as well.
- Don't commit `.DS_Store` files to git. Please [remove them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository) I recommend ignoring it at a global
level on your machine, but you can also add it to your project's `.gitignore`
- Work on your app, committing and pushing changes as you go along.

- Read [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/accessibility)

If you want, start messing around with Swift in the [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)
app or in Xcode.

### Links and Resources

- [swift.org](https://www.swift.org)
  - "Getting Started" is about installation. You probably don't need this after
  installing Xcode.
  - The [Swift Book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) section of the site is
  great.
  - We will be continuing on to [The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) after today's assignment, "A Swift Tour".

- I mentioned the [Stanford SwiftUI course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu) as an excellent resource for learning some fundamentals of Swift and SwiftUI.

## 01 — Introduction

2022-08-22, Monday

- [slides](01-Introduction.html)

### Action Items:

- Download, Install and open [Xcode 14](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Install Command Line Tools when directed.
- Make sure you have an Apple ID and sign in to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) with it.
- Have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

[Xcode Releases](https://xcodereleases.com) is a handy site that organizes download links to versions of Xcode.

I mentioned the [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)
app for iPad, but I forgot that there's a Mac version too! This is a great way
to get started with Swift, so check that out too.
