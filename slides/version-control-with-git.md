# Git

- ubiquitous
- powerful
- "good enough"

## Cons:
- obtuse, hard to understand

---

- Pull Requests, code reviews
- Branching, Merging


---

# Setup your environment

`git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"`
`git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"`

---

## Not your own machine?

Great opportunity to setup a workflow for configuring a system in the way that
you want it.

## Other "version control software" tools

- mercurial

- subversion


---

# Gotchas

- passwords, API keys, other private info
  - .gitignore
- Can other people build it?
