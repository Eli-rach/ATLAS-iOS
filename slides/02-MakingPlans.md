  installing Xcode.
  - The [Swift Book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) section of the site is
  great.
  - Read [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html).
  - We will be continuing on to [The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) from there, which is linked at the bottom of the tour.
