## You were lied to.

The [course description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRoVL8WLgDbpwAF4omonWs6cNrovlE1mLtHyOyC40ESNVz7WgUQLUhPTMZ3B62I6TwZCZ5sZnP5uOGn/pub) states:

> Focuses technically on the iOS and Android platforms

* I don't know Android.

## The Goal:

- Teach you how to develop apps.

* Holistic.
* How to code.
* Talk about App design, UI, UX.
* Learn software engineering practices and principles.
* Use development tools like `git` and the command line.
* Collaborate. Perform code reviews. Encourage and influence one another.
* Generally interesting and useful, even if you never write another app.

<!--
Not just "how to code"

- Can't learn everything, if we tried to, it would be outdated by the time we finished.
- Principles
- Write, understand, and debug code
- Learn how learn, how to figure it out on your own
- the mindset using a computer as a developer
- I hope to provide a unique opportunity
-->

---

## I hope that you will:
* Ask questions. Engage. Interrupt.
  * Otherwise, just go watch videos and read tutorials.
* Share ideas. Find examples.
* Disagree.
* See things I don’t see, and say something.
* Teach me.
* Make cool stuff.

<!--
Examples of:

Patterns, good and bad
Pitfalls

Great user interfaces
Bad user interfaces
-->

## Grading:


```swift
func calculateGrade() -> Float {
  // TODO: Don't forget to implement this before class
  return 0
}
```

## My story

# Question Time!


## What are your goals?

- Why do you want to learn iOS development?

- What do you think of when you picture what an app is made of?

- What do you think of when you picture the process of making an app?

- Regarding mobile app development, what are your primary interests?

- How many people don't have a Mac to use?
- Do you have an iPhone or iPad?

- Do you want a chatroom?

---


---

## The Plan

- Rant
- [HIG](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview) Review
- Code Reviews. Refactoring.

<!-- have worked with designers that simply didn't know the HIG -->

---

## Directives
