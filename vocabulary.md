## API

"Application Programming Interface"

1) The code interface that we use to access features and functions in a
programming environment

2) A web-based system for retrieving data from a web server


## Persistence

The ability for software to store and read data.

## Refactoring

Reworking code without changing behavior.

## Localization

Localization is closely related to Internationalization, which is the process of
preparing an app for use in other languages and regions.

Internationalization is commonly abbreviated as `I18N`.

## Mutability

The ability for an object to be changed.

In Swift:

```swift
let number = 10
// number is immutable and cannot be changed

var number = 10
// number is mutable and can be changed
```

## Dotfiles

"Invisible" files that help configure developer tools and other software.
