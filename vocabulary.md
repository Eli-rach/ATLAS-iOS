### Refactoring

Reworking code without changing behavior.

### Localization

Translating an application's strings into other languages.

Localization is closely related to Internationalization, which is the process of
preparing an app for use in other languages and regions.

Internationalization is commonly abbreviated as `I18N`.

### Mutability

The ability for an object to be changed.

In Swift:

```swift
let number = 10
// number is immutable and cannot be changed

var number = 10
// number is mutable and can be changed
```

### Dotfiles

"Invisible" files that help configure developer tools and other software.
